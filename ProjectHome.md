We often require the IP address of the current machine. If you’re tired of opening a DOS box and typing ipconfig, here’s a small tool that copies the IP address and puts it into the clipboard. (Rename .txt to .exe)

Just put the exe into your system path (eg %windir%\system32), and then run ipclip from start – run menu.
